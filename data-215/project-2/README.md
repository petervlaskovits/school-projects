# Project 2 - Machine Learning

In this class project, I used the [bank marketing dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/) from the University of California, Irvine machine learning repository.
I performed a brief exploratory data analysis before then preparing the data for use to compare three different machine learning models to choose the most optimal model for deploying in a real life scenario. 

The EDA can be found in eda.ipynb, while the actual project can be found in project.ipynb.
