# Project 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis

In this class project, I combined data from the [100,000 used cars from the United Kingdom datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityadesai13/used-car-dataset-ford-and-mercedes) on Kaggle and conducted an exploratory data analysis on all of the used cars.

My exploratory data analysis and other technical details can be found in the project.ipynb file.
